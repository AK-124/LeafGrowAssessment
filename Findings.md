#For Input Component
In Input component testing: While tetsing, I have come to know that the input component was not working when the focus is out and doesn't hold the values. Moreover, there is no enter button.
There is no way we can get the sectors for arrow up and arrow down in the input component.

#For Tables:
The edit and delete buttons were  not functioning so i couldn't perform any testing on it.
